A full adder is designed in quantum cellular automata. Reversible methodology is followed in the construction of the adder as irrevesiblility has an issue of loss of information.

The reversible full adder is build using 123 cells. Using which, a 3bit comparator is designed for the operations '=', '>', '<'.

The repository includes the design files of reversible full adder, 3bit comparator, qca setup.
